## Summary

We wanted to be able to explore the amazing trail covered in the famous 'Three Capes' walk, without needing to wait for a spot or spending a decent whack of money to do so! Hence researching a way to run 2 of the 3 capes in one go with this 40km route. You will run through a mix of single track and boardwalks mostly, all very well maintained. Absolutely brilliant coastline, there's a reason this walk is as popular as it is!
