## Summary

A pretty cool track in what feels like the middle of absolutely nowhere. You'll have the option to check out two lakes along the way to Hartz Peak - would recommend the slight detour to check them out.The summit has a fair bit of rock scramble to reach the top and is very exposed. We didn't have the best weather on our attempt with strong winds and moderate rain, so turned around before reaching the summit. We unfortunately also had only about 40m of visibility so couldn't see very much, but from looking at other photos of the track it looks like the veiws can be spectacular if you get a decent day! This track is close to Tahune Adventures (think tree top walk, swinging bridges, that kind of thing), if you have extra time would recommend checking that out too.

## Practical information

**Gear suggestions**: As mentioned above, it's an alpine region - so recommend packing the gear for it.
Parts of the trail are very exposed.

## Adventure description

This was a fun and pretty short adventure. We got a bit unlucky with the weather, and I'm not going to lie, definitley did NOT have the appropriate gear for the day. It was windy, the rain kicked in about halfway through, and outfit of shorts, singlets and fleece jacket didn't cut it. Having moved from QLD to TAS only a few weeks before, we had no cold weather gear at all. It was straight to the shops after the run to buy a raincoat and warmer layers. Point being, learn from us and take the right gear, it's an alpine region.

You'll kick off from the visitor centre, right at the carpark. Be sure to sign in using the walkers log book before heading off. And make sure you've got your National Park pass sorted too.

The first part of the trail is a mix of single track, wooden boardwalks, and metal boardwalks. It's all very runable terrain and a bit of undulation but nothing hectic. You'll get to the first optional lake detour (Lake Esperance) - the detour is not long at all and we were very glad to check it out. Met a bunch of friendly hikers down at the lake too, who thought we were mad in shorts + singlets and wanted to take a photo of us!

You'll keep running, again along very runnable terrain until you reach the second lake. It's a very very short path to the lake (called Ladies Tarn, so maybe not a lake at all?), again would recommend checking it out.

You'll then start the ascent to Hartz Peak. We got to the rock scramble near the end before the poor weather conditions forced us to turn around due to safety. So I can't tell you what the final part of the track is like or what the views would be like on a good day!

The entire track is well signed and marked making it a fun and fairly approachable adventure.
