**Best time to complete**: You'll be running into an alpine region towards the top of kunanyi, so pack accordingly. There are taps available along the way, however most do say 'untreated', so best to carry adequate water or some way to treat the water if preferred.

## Adventure description

Amazing diversity of trail along this route and an incredibly rewarding climb to the top of kunanyi with views of the entire city and surrounds below.

- The course starts by following some of the streets in Mount Nelson for about 1-2kms before you enter fire trail. You can park closer to the firetrail start if preferred, however the views through the streets of Mount Nelson are quite stunning in themselves.
- You'll then run along fire trail for the next few kms, slightly undulating uphill, but nothing too steep at this point. Nice surface and not technical running.

- Next you'll follow Pipeline track until you reach Fern Tree park and then continue up to the Springs. This whole section is fantastic forest area, enjoy dense foliage and lots of bright green moss on every surface. More technical single track in parts.
- You'll pass right by Lost Freight Cafe - a great stop on the way up or back for a coffee and a nibble. There's also toilets here.
- Then it's pretty much up, up, up to the summit! Be sure to go all the way to the official viewpoint at the top. The views are definitely worth the last little bit of climbing.
- When you're ready, turn back around the way you came all the way back to the start.
