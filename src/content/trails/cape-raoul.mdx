## Adventure description

This out and back course will start and end with a bunch of undulating terrain and through forest. When you leave the forest you'll start to run near the cliffline - initially you'll be up pretty high! If at this stage you don't have great visibility, don't worry too much, you'll traverse to lower altitude and hopefully that visibility might improve. (That's what happened for us anwyay! From nothing but a view of the clouds to a stunning outlook a few kms later.)

After you have decended a bit further along the trail, you will run across a mix of boardwalk and trail, before you get back to some awesome cliff side views. Once you reach the end, you'll turn around and head back the way you've come.

This whole course features smooth terrain, great views, and our time out on this trail absolutely flew by! This has definitely been marked as a trail to repeat multiple times.
