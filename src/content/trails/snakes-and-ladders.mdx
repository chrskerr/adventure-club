## Summary

This adventure turned out to be a beast! Overall kms and elevation are solid, however the real challenge to this adventure is the technical terrain. This made it slow, but also for us very very fun! If you enjoy technical trail running and a huge variety of terrain, then this adventure is definitely for you. If you are less confident with technical terrain, you'll be in for a long walk without much running. Adjust your expectations of duration accordingly and take adequate clothing, food and water.

Throughout this adventure you will see it all - spectacular 360 views from the top of the major climb, river crossings, a beautiful mix of landscapes, and a few kms of rock hopping towards the end (there will be literally nothing but boulders on the side of the mountain in sight - we had never seen anything like it before, was pretty incredible).

## Practical information

Start point: The Springs, Kunanyi. Right near Lost Freight Cafe. All day free parking available right near start location too.

Best time to complete: You'll be getting to high elevation throughout this run and crossing ridgelines, so be sure to check the weather and the wind as you will be quite exposed in parts.

Gear suggestions: As mentioned above, parts of the trail are very exposed so be sure to have the gear approprite for those conditions. Remember, this adventure is going to be much slower than you anticipate from the kms & elevation numbers alone! Be sure to take the food, water and clothing you will require for a 5hr+ adventure.

Facilities: Toilets available at parking lot at start/end. Lost Freight Cafe is right near the start/end too, if you want a post adventure feed!

Fees and registration: No fees. No walkers log book either.

## Adventure description

She was a big one! We tackled this route after discovering it on Wilder Trails. Wilder Trails has the GPX route available for purchase for AUD$5 for those wishing to download the route. There are a few turns along the course that are easy to miss as they are secondary trails rather than the more commonly trod routes, so the GPX file downloaded to our Garmin was a massive help.

You'll go through a few distinct sections along this adventure:

- Up, up, slowly up single track. The trail starts at a reasonable elevation, so you'll start to get some great views pretty much straight away!
- Really fun single track that opens up out of the forest - you're running on compact dirt with a trench in the middle. This was super fun, it almost felt like we were parkour running, as you end up jumping off either side of the trail to avoid the trench (it's not deep, maybe 50cm, so pretty safe)
- Wide firetrail for a few kms - the cruisiest bit of the day by far!
- River crossings - when you do the first river crossing please note that the track down to the river is VERY easy to miss. Highly recommend keeping an eye on the GPS for this bit. The track on the other side of the river is more or less directly opposite the track you've taken to get down (just a little bit to the right).
- Once you've crossed the river you'll then start climbing UP. It's steep, but nice smooth track for the majority of the climb.
- Just before the top you'll have a bit more of a scramble, before getting out to the top with absolutely spectacular 360 views.
- It's then time to cross the ridgeline, this was really fun. We took it slowly as it was fairly challenging.
- From here on the trail is pretty damn technical. Beautiful terrain, but not easy running at all.
- Eventually you'll get to the rock garden section (called the 'Potato fields'), which was really beautiful, if not very slow going. It felt like 2-3kms of pure rock hopping.
- Before you then rejoin the first little bit of the trail that you set out down. And you can finally run again back to the car, hooray!

Overall this was a pretty epic adventure. It was hard to believe that this rugged trail exists so close to Hobart city centre. Was a great day out.
